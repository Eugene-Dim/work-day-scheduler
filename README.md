# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
The goal of this project is to create a scheduler for the current day.

Description:
The final project displays typical a work day schedule form 7am - 5pm. 
The user is able to enter to do lists or other information and save it to the scheduler. 
The information is saved so that once the page refreshes the information stays on the page. 
The clear button will clear everything on the page.
